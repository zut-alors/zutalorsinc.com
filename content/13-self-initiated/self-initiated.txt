Title: Self-Initiated
----
Text: The fact that we are, in fact, not artists. There is the occassional veneer of &ldquo;art&rdquo;, but the things we make are always in service (and if not always, then 99.99% of the time) to business, and if not business, then to someone else's idea(s) or need(s).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quixotic, ultimately self-defeating, to become involved in this field and think that your own needs, your &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; vision, should always be satisfied; you are in all actuality, a conduit for other human beings' ideas. You speak for other people; and that in itself is a beautiful and formidable responsibility. It is also one that does not have to live in the shadow of any romantic notions about creativity.
