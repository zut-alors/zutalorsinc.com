Text: They walked hand in hand through many different rooms in the museum. The hushed air of the space was dense, it became the third character in their romance novel; the third character along with all those figures in all those paintings. Old lords, Jesus Chirst and the broad swaths of brown that Barnett Newman was so fond of; all them were characters in the story also. Those same characters watched raptly as the young lovers walked hip to hip between the modern and old master wing; he put his hand around her waist and said softly, &ldquo;You are my masterpiece!&rdquo; A figure in a Breugel painting on the wall over her shoulder winced and started to tremble like a popcorn kernel in hot oil.
