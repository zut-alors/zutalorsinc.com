Text: I am the slackening pace of a race coming closed. I am also the quickening pace of the blood thru my veins during the same race. You are one seven billionth of the whole. You are also the center of your entire, own universe, all important and all encompassing. You rode a crowded early morning 6 train with roughly 2500 other universes. We are the culmination of 14 billion years of evolution. We are the composers of the Arc de Triomphe and the Golden Gate Bridge; we are the manufacturers and consumers of cell phone cases with bunny ears.
